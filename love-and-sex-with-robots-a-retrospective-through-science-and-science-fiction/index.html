      <p><strong>&lt;Disclaimer&gt; All contents of this blog post are, as usual, my
thoughts alone, and don’t reflect the views of my lab, advisor,
university, or funding agencies. &lt;/Disclaimer&gt;</strong></p>

<p>In his 2007 book <em>Love and Sex with Robots</em>, David Levy paints a
picture of a world in which romantic and sexual relations with robots
are not only possible, but commonplace, and argues that such a future
is not only possible, but inevitable.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I’ll provide some of my thoughts on Levy’s book,
and provide some commentary from recent science and science
fiction on the issues Levy raises (or fails to raise). While robot
ethics is of great interest to me, and a topic my lab actively
researches, it’s not one I myself have published on, which is to say, 
I’m new to the topic and am eager to hear counter-arguments to any of
the positions I take!</p>

<p>Levy’s book is broken into two main sections, regarding love and sex
respectively. I’ll deal with each section separately. (Before these
sections, however, appears a 25-page introduction which deserves
mention. In this short section, Levy presents an excellent
introduction to Human-Robot Interaction and Social Robotics. Highly
recommended for those interested but uninitiated in HRI.)</p>

<h1 id="love">Love</h1>
<p>To argue for the inevitability of human-robot love, Levy begins by
discussing why humans love each other. From this, he draws parallels
to the love humans feel for their pets, to the love humans feel for
virtual pets. From this point, it’s not hard to extrapolate further
and see that if we create humanoid robots that provide the same
social cues that produce feelings of attachment towards each
other, pets, etc., then humans will almost certainly fall in love with
them. 
While Levy lays this out logically, I do take issue with two aspects
of his account.</p>

<p>First, Levy is far too optimistic about
the technical developments necessary for his vision to occur. Levy
breezes through a rash of technical challenges, dismissing them as
easy to solve and right around the corner. If Levy had simply stated
that such things were <em>in theory</em> possible, without the undue
futurism, his argument would have been much more convincing.</p>

<p>Second, Levy describes human-robot love as broadly positive and
therapeutic, suggesting that within a few decades, human-robot
marriages will be commonplace. While I think it’s interesting to
deconstruct marriage in this way, and to ponder whether the right to
choose one’s life partner (arguably the whole point of marriage)
translates logically to humans marrying robots, it’s important to
recognize that just because this <em>could</em> happen does not mean, as Levy
seems to assume, that it <em>should</em> happen. In fact, some researchers
have argued that the entire notion of human emotional attachment to
robots is deeply problematic.</p>

<h2 id="the-science-of-human-robot-love">The Science of Human-Robot Love</h2>

<p>One outspoken critic of social robots is my advisor, Matthias
Scheutz. In his 2011 chapter of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Robot-Ethics-Implications-Intelligent-Autonomous/dp/026252600X">“Robot Ethics”</a>,
entitled <em>The Inherent Dangers of Unidirectional 
Emotional Bonds between Humans and Social Robots</em>, Scheutz argues that
social robots may inflict <em>emotional harm</em> on their users.
People are incredibly quick to ascribe agency and mental states to
robots as if they were alive, allowing robots to affect people in the
same way that their pets do. This causes people to treat robots
much differently than they would other pieces of technology. If you have a good
dishwasher, it’s unlikely you’ll give it the occasional “night off”
and wash the dishes by hand as a reward for good behavior; but there
have been reports of people doing just that for their
Roombas (more crazy stories
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/c35.pdf">here</a>). Imagine what people
will do for robots that look humanoid, or can speak in natural language!</p>

<p>This is the root of the danger of social robots: it takes almost
nothing for people to form “relationships” with their robots, but
these are relationships that are not reciprocated; the robots do not
necessarily care about humans at all! This presents a tremendous
opportunity for mass exploitation: a robotics company could easily
program their robot to convince owners to do things they would not
otherwise do, like buy a particular product.</p>

<p>There are other concerns about these unidirectional relationships
beyond their potential for abuse. Philosopher Robert Sparrow
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~social/reading/Sparrow1.pdf">argues</a>
that robot pets are in and of themselves dangerous and
unethical. Sparrow argues that robot pets are grounded in deception
and that in order to benefit from a robot pet, one must
“systematically delude themselves 
regarding the real nature of their relation with the animal,” an act
which he deems “morally deplorable.”</p>

<p>Sparrow goes on to argue that this gap in reality will be even more
pronounced in the case of humanoid robots, as such robots will be even
more likely to provoke feelings such as love and respect, which, when
based on illusion, would once again be “morally deplorable.” Says
Sparrow, “It would be wrong to design android
robots with the intention of generating such responses.”</p>

<p>While I agree that this is an important and dangerous point in the
case of robots that are humanlike and/or have natural language
capabilities, I have trouble viewing this as truly problematic for
non-humanoid, non-verbal entities.</p>

<p>Sparrow argues that relationships with “real” pets are not morally
deplorable because animals can have experiences, are moral patients
who we can treat with compassion, etc. This may be true, but pet
owners systematically delude themselves about certain aspects of their
pets’ behaviors and mental states. Recent research has suggested that
<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135109#sec001">cats don’t rely on their owners for safety and
security</a>,
that <a href="http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z94-147#.Vu6fTh-c3on">cats rubbing up against people may just be them marking their
territory</a>,
and that
<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/">even purring may be more of a self-therapeutic mechanism</a>
or a response to stress than an expression of happiness. Are relationships
with cats harmful due to the imbalanced social bonds between cat and
owner? (Side note: of course cats are harmful for other reasons, such
as the fact that they infect people with a parasite that <a href="http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/167.abstract">doubles one’s
risk of schizophrenia</a>.)
If it’s okay to delude ourselves into thinking we have the love of our
cats, let alone gerbils, fish, and lizards, then I have difficulty
viewing (language-incapable) robot pets as being “morally deplorable”.</p>

<h2 id="the-science-fiction-of-human-robot-love">The Science Fiction of Human-Robot Love</h2>
<p>A number of recent pieces of science fiction have also delved into the
possible problems with human-robot love. 
<strong>(Be prepared to skip this section if you want to avoid spoilers.)</strong></p>

<h3 id="black-mirror">Black Mirror</h3>

<p><img src="../images/laswr/black-mirror.png" alt="Be Right Back" />
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Perhaps the best example comes from <em>Be Right Back</em>, Season 2 Episode 1 of the
Channel 4 / Netflix show <em>Black Mirror</em>. In that episode, a woman (Martha, played
by Hayley Atwell) finds herself
widowed, and is suggested an app to help her grieve: when provided
with a loved one’s social media profile, the app will create a chatbot
that talks just like the deceased. Given more data, the app becomes
realistic. Martha uses the app, giving it more and more data (and
money) to the point that they are able to send her a humanoid replica
of her husband (Ash, played by Domhnall Gleeson). The show goes on to
demonstrate the psychological harm 
this inflicts upon Martha: because of the android, Martha does not
move forward with her life, and instead keeps the robot around
<strong>(possibly against her own wishes)</strong> for years to come.
The episode also shows how the android copy of
Ash is able to coerce Martha into keeping it around.
Because Martha chooses to devote her emotional
energy to the android rather than seeking out relationships with other
people the robot can be seen as an enabler for mental harm.</p>

<h3 id="her">Her</h3>

<p><img src="../images/laswr/her.jpg" alt="Her" />
<br /><br /></p>

<p>In a similar vein, we have one of my favorite movies,
<em>Her</em>. Technically, <em>Her</em> 
focuses on love between a human (Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix)
and an <em>artificially intelligent agent</em> (Samantha, played by Scarlett
Johansson). This
leads to several scenarios which are harder to envision between a
human and a robot, such as the possibility of an AI 
falling deeply, truly, in love with hundreds or thousands of
people simultaneously. In <em>Her</em>, however, the problems of
unidirectional social bonds 
do not seem to manifest; because Samantha is such an incredibly
sophisticated AI, one could argue that she really does love Theodore,
and thus the social bonds between Samantha and Theodore are truly
reciprocated. And yet, we see the same types of value judgments
against this relationship. Theodore’s ex-wife, at least, views the
relationship as unhealthy, and takes it as a sign that Theodore is
simply not mature enough to handle a “real” relationship.</p>

<p>In both cases, the relationship with the artificial agent is shown as
emotionally and psychologically damaging.
I’ll be interested to see in a few decades whether this
view will be taken as a legitimate concern or merely as
prejudice against one’s choice of partner.</p>

<h3 id="master-of-none">Master of None</h3>

<p><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/96962aecee6cc03dfe9430e14849b1b8/tumblr_nxkbz966FX1qjcyqno1_500.gif" alt="Paro" /><br />
<br /><br /></p>

<p>On a different note, we have <em>Old People</em>, Season One, Episode Eight
of Aziz Ansari’s hilarious Netflix show, <em>Master of None</em>. The B-plot
for the episode revolves around Paro the robot seal (which you can <a href="http://www.parorobots.com/photogallery.asp">buy
for a cool 7k</a>), a
real-life therapy robot which provides companionship to the elderly. 
In this episode, Paro is viewed extremely positively; and I have to
agree with how it’s depicted. Yes, Paro may be damaging on some
level because it cannot truly reciprocate the relationship. But
neither can a fish or lizard, and Paro has been shown to effect real
health benefits, both physically and mentally. From a utilitarian
standpoint, I would argue that these benefits outweigh any negatives;
and since Paro can only make adorable seal sounds, and cannot actually
speak, there’s little risk of Paro coercing its owner into, e.g.,
switching to Fix-a-Dent.</p>

<h1 id="sex">Sex</h1>

<p>In the second section of his book, Levy sets forth to argue that <em>sex</em>
with widespread robots is inevitable. I think that Levy does a better
job of making a convincing argument in this section, in part because
he doesn’t 
have to rely on rampant futurism: no sophisticated AI capabilities are
necessary for the greater part of a sex robot’s necessary functioning,
and what is more, <strong>sex robots are already here</strong>.</p>

<p>As Levy describes, at the time of the book’s writing hundreds of
highly realistic humanoid sex robots were being sold each year from a
single company. That company has now sold <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/technology/robotica-sex-robot-realdoll.html?emc=edit_th_20150612&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=1638&amp;_r=1">over 5000 sex robots</a>.
This highlights the importance of having discussions about this issue:
unlike super-intelligent AI, which certain famous intellectuals have
gotten worked up about, the concern with sex robots isn’t whether
they’ll exist in the next half-millenium. Sex robots are already
here, and they have the capacity to drastically alter society in the
course of the next few <em>decades</em>.</p>

<p>Building on his description of the state of sex robots, Levy describes
a host of convincing situations in which sex robots might be used. 
I won’t directly comment on them, as each could fill its own blog
post, but I’ll list out some of them as food for thought.</p>

<p>Sex robots may be used by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Those with STDs such as AIDS that can make it <em>irresponsible</em> to
have sex with others.</li>
  <li>Those for whom it’s <em>physically difficult</em> to
have sex with others, such as the disabled.</li>
  <li>Those for whom it’s <em>mentally</em> difficult to have sex with others,
such as the very shy or (at least in their own minds) very ugly.</li>
  <li>Those whose sexual desires would be physically or mentally
damaging to human partners.</li>
  <li>Those simply wanting to have different or more interesting sex, or
those seeking to learn or practice their sexual skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these are reasons why people choose to visit
prostitutes. While there’s some concern about robots taking the jobs
of sex workers, there’s something to be said about robot sex workers
who can’t be exploited, can’t get or spread diseases, and can’t be
hurt. Before I move on, I’d like to quote some facts laid out by Levy
about the history of prostitution which I found pretty surprising.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the 1800s, it’s estimated that between 10 and 25 percent of <em>all
young women</em> in New York City were prostitutes, making prostitution
the second largest business of the time after tailoring.</li>
  <li>In the mid-20th century, Alfred Kinsey estimated that 69\% of white
American men had been to a prostitute at least once.</li>
  <li>A survey in the mid-20th century found that 47\% of French men who
were practicing Catholics had lost their virginity to a prostitute.</li>
  <li>In 2000, there were an estimated 30,000 male prostitutes in Thailand.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to note that the concerns over sex robots extend beyond
robots designed for sex. Recently, the robotics company Aldebaran
released a new robot, Pepper, shown below.</p>

<p><br /><br />
<img src="../images/laswr/pepper.jpg" alt="Pepper" />
<br /><br /></p>

<p>There’s nothing inherently
sexual about Pepper. At the most, you could point out that there’s a
touchscreen on Pepper’s “chest” area. But even that is a bit of a
stretch. Even so, Aldebaran felt the need to release a disclaimer that
Pepper must not be used “for sexual activity and actions for the
purpose of indecent acts, or acts for the purpose of meeting and
dating and making acquaintance of the opposite sex”. If Aldebaran
thought it was such a concern for a robot like Pepper, this perhaps
signals that this issue should engender even greater concern for
roboticists who design more human-like robots, to say nothing of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF39Ygp53mQ">those
who develop androids</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-science-fiction-of-sex-with-robots">The Science-Fiction of Sex with Robots</h2>
<p><strong>(Be prepared to skip this section if you want to avoid spoilers.)</strong></p>

<p>It’s hard not to feel like this is all science fiction. And indeed,
sex robots have been showing up more and more in popular culture. The
artificially intelligent agents discussed above (i.e., those seen in
<em>Her</em> and <em>Black Mirror</em>) are good examples, but of course the best
recent example is <em>Ex Machina</em>’s Ava.</p>

<h3 id="ex-machina">Ex Machina</h3>

<p><img src="../images/laswr/exmachina.jpg" alt="Ex Machina" />
<br /><br /></p>

<p>In <em>Ex Machina</em>, Caleb (also played by Domhnall Gleeson) is brought to
a secluded woodland estate, ostensibly  to help “test” a new android,
Ava (played by Alicia Vikander), who is
incredibly humanlike, highly intelligent, and clearly designed to be
physically attractive to her creator.
As the film progresses, we learn that Ava (and other robots) have been
sexually exploited by their creator, Nathan (played by Oscar Isaac). And,
eventually, we see how Ava is able to seduce and control Caleb, and
use him to help her get away from Nathan.</p>

<p>The questions raised by this movie are questions we’ll have to deal
with as a society as robots become more commonplace: should we be
developing humanlike robots that are overtly sexual in appearance or
behavior? Should we be developing robots that have the capacity for
suffering or sorrow? Using the arguments presented in the previous
section, it would seem that if a robot is programmed to be incapable
of suffering and is not capable of having its own goals and desires,
then such a robot cannot be the subject of cruelty, coercion,
exploitation, etc. That being said, whether the actions of a human
towards a sex robot say something about or affect <em>their character</em> is
another question, and a valid argument against using robots for
certain purposes or treating them in a certain way. However, that’s a
topic for another day.</p>

<h2 id="the-science-of-sex-with-robots">The Science of Sex with Robots</h2>

<p>Obviously this topic raises a number of complicated ethical questions; and
I think that these questions are important for us to discuss as a
society. However, there has been little research thus far into 
peoples’ views on the topic. Recently, I helped my
advisor and one of my labmates conduct
the first extensive survey into people’s views on sex robots, the
results of which were the focus of a recent paper (<em>Are We Ready for
Sex Robots?</em>).</p>

<p>In this study, we asked participants questions in three main
categories: what they believe to be the capabilities of
sex robots, what they believe to be the appropriate uses and
appearances for sex robots, and how sex with a robot differs from sex
with a person. These questions were posed to ~100 subjects ages 20-60
through an online survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>

<p>The study found
that men and women are in close agreement on the capabilities of sex
robots: participants generally thought that sex robots could be
instructed, could move on their own, and are specifically designed
to satisfy human desire, and that sex robots could <em>not</em> have feelings,
recognize human emotions, or take initiative. Participants were more
evenly split on a number of other criteria, such as whether sex robots 
can adapt to human behavior, understand language, learn new
behaviors, or recognize objects. Men and women also agreed on the
differences between sex with a robot vs. sex with a person;
participants tended to say that sex with a robot would not cause one
to lose their virginity, was more like masturbation than sex with a
human, and was more like using a vibrator than having sex with a human.</p>

<p>Men and women significantly differed, however, on the appropriate uses
and appearances for sex robots, with men systematically viewing uses
and appearances as more appropriate, typically by about one-point on a
seven-point scale. The uses for sex robots ranked most appropriate
were using them instead of prostitutes, for disabled people, to reduce
the risk of spreading STDs, to demonstrate forms of sexual
harassment (for training and prevention), and for use in isolated
environments; the uses ranked least 
appropriate were using sex robots to practice abstinence, and for sex
offenders; for all of these, the mean rating leant towards appropriate for
men and towards inappropriate for women. The appearances of sex robots
ranked most appropriate were an adult human, a fantasy creature, and
“any recognizable life form”. The forms ranked least appropriate were
an animal, one’s family member, and the only form for which ratings
did not significantly differ between men and women: a human child.
Finally, two-thirds of men said they would use a sex-robot, while
two-thirds of women said they would not.
You’ll note that the above results are all gender-based. One would
think that one would see age effects as well; but in fact, only one
significant age effect was found: Millenials rated it less appropriate
to use robots /instead of prostitutes/ than did older participants.</p>

<p>These results give a brief look into society’s views on sex
robots. The Human-Robot Interaction community will need to further
investigate these questions through empirical study, so that we can
better understand peoples’ ethical values and principles involving sex
robots. These values will be crucial for society to make explicit as
sex robots become increasingly commonplace, and a subject of concern
for policymakers, designers, industry, and society at large.</p>

<h1 id="overall-recommendation">Overall Recommendation</h1>
<p>While its occasional deviations into futurism make it less than it
could have been, <em>Love and Sex with Robots</em> is an engaging, eye
opening, and entertaining read. I recommend it highly to anyone
interested in human-robot interaction, sociology, and sexuality.</p>
