      <p>The Guardium UGV is an unmanned tank used by the Israeli military to
patrol the Gaza border. It is able to patrol autonomously, but its
weapon systems can only be engaged by remote human operators. 
The Goalkeeper CIWS is a point defense cannon used on Naval ships that
is able to autonomously target and fire upon rapidly approaching
torpedoes. 
What if the autonomous target identification and firing mechanisms of
the Goalkeeper were used in military robots such as the Guardian,
which operate in civilian theaters?</p>

<p>Such fully autonomous weapon systems are the topic of considerable
debate, and the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons is
considering a preemptive ban on such weapons, similar to bans
enacted against, e.g., blinding lasers and antipersonnel mines. Such a
ban would prohibit the development and deployment of such weapons, as
well as any research that could have no benefit beyond the development
of these weapons.</p>

<p>As a research ban would primarily affect the Artificial
Intelligence community, many AI researchers have spoken up for or
against a ban, and on January 29th, a public debate on the issue
was held in Austin, Texas at the 2015 AAAI Conference, one of the
field of AI’s premiere conferences.</p>

<h2 id="the-debate">The Debate</h2>

<p>Arguing in favor of a comprehensive, preemptive ban on fully
autonomous weapon systems was the director of the Human Rights Watch,
Stephen Goose. Under Goose’s direction, the HRW has been instrumental
in the banning of blinding lasers, cluster munitions, landmines, and
other weapons.</p>

<p>Arguing against such a ban was Ron Arkin of Georgia Tech. Arkin is a
researcher in robotics and robot ethics, and is known for his “Ethical
Governor”, a proposed system for preventing robots from performing
unethical actions (gross simplification).</p>

<p>The debate, moderated by AAAI President Tom Dietterich and held in
front of a crowd of hundreds of AI researchers, took the form of
fifteen-minute position statements, four-minute rebuttals, questions
posed by audience members, and two-minute closing statements.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I hope to relay the gist of each debator’s arguments. As
this is a sensative topic, I will add my brief commentary at the end
of the post but otherwise focus on relaying the course of the debate
as truthfully and fully as possible. I must also state at this point
that any opinions I do communicate on this topic are mine alone and do
not reflect any policy or collective opinion of the Tufts HRI Lab.</p>

<h2 id="point-ron-arkin">Point: Ron Arkin</h2>

<p>First to speak was Arkin, whose presentation was entitled “Lethal
Autonomous Weapon Systems and the Plight of the Noncombatant”. It is
important to stress that while Arkin was arguing against an outright
ban, he was not arguing in favor of autonomous lethal weapons. Arkin
stated that he was against all killing, and that while he was in
principle not averse to such a ban, he believed that we should not
rush into the deployment of one until the issue had been
thoroughly considered, and that for the time being we would be better
served by a moratorium on such weapons.</p>

<p>Arkin’s rationale for this position stemmed from his belief that it is
possible that autonomous weapon systems may in fact be able to be used
for good, and save noncombatant lives. He asserted that the status quo
of the noncombatant today is wholly unacceptable, and that robotics
and AI can make wartime atrocities against noncombatants less likely
to occur. “I am convinced”, said Arkin, “that [unmanned systems used
as adjuncts to human soldiers] can perform more ethically than human
soldiers are capable.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I am convinced that they can perform more ethically than human
 soldiers are capable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In previous talks, Arkin has used a series of sobering statistics to
make this point. Here are a few, taken verbatim from his 2010 paper in
the Journal of Military Ethics entitled “The Case for Ethical Autonomy
in Unmanned Systems”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Approximately 10 percent of Soldiers and Marines report mistreating
noncombatants (damaged/destroyed Iraqi property when not necessary or
hit/kicked a noncombatant when not necessary).</li>
  <li>Only 47 percent of Soldiers and 38 percent of Marines agreed that
noncombatants should be treated with dignity and respect.</li>
  <li>Although they reported receiving ethical training, 28 percent of
Soldiers and 31 percent of Marines reported facing ethical
situations in which they did not know how to respond.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arkin did not lay out all of these statistics during the debate, but
stressed that while he has great respect for our men and women in
uniform, the battlefield tempo is simply outpacing human ability to
make ethical and accurate decisions.</p>

<p>Fortunately for noncombatants, robots may be able to perform more
ethically than humans, for a variety of reasons cited by Arkin:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Robots are able to act conservatively</li>
  <li>Robot sensors are better equipped for battlefield observations</li>
  <li>Robots can be designed without emotions</li>
  <li>Robots would not fall victim to human “scenario fulfillment”</li>
  <li>Robots can integrate multi-source information far faster</li>
  <li>Robots can independently and objectively monitor the ethical
behavior of all parties on the battlefield</li>
</ul>

<p>Arkin believes that if it is possible to create unmanned adjuncts to
human soldiers that can act more ethically than their human teammates,
then the development of such adjuncts is a <strong>moral imperative</strong>, and
constitutes a <strong>humanitarian effort</strong>. As adjuncts, autonomous weapons would not replace
humans, but would be used alongside them; a human would always be in
their control loop.</p>

<h2 id="counterpoint-steven-goose">Counterpoint: Steven Goose</h2>

<p>Before relaying Goose’s arguments, I must state that my summary of his
remarks come from a nearly identical talk he gave during the “AI &amp;
Ethics” workshop conducted on the first day of the conference. I
apologize if I inadvertently include any points raised during his
workshop talk that did not actually come up during the debate.</p>

<p>While Arkin was emphatic that he was opposed to all killing, Goose was
emphatic that he was not opposed to military robots, but only to fully
autonomous weapon systems.</p>

<p>Goose asserted that while there were clearly many possible advantages
to autonomous weapons, these were outweighed by the negatives, and
that any possible advantages would not be lost by keeping a human in
control.</p>

<p>Goose’s laid out several objections to what he terms “Killer Robots”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A belief that it is simply morally wrong to give robots decisions
over life and death, and that this would constitute a “loss of
humanity” in more ways than one</li>
  <li>The Geneva Conventions’ “Martin’s Clause” which dictates that fully
autonomous weapons should comply with the dictates of public
conscience, which he argues they do not</li>
  <li>The unlikeliness that killer robots would comply with the
distinction of proportionality and other inherently subjective human
judgements</li>
  <li>The fact that robots could accidentally circumvent the rights of
combatants who are injured or who have surrendered</li>
  <li>The accountability gap: a robot can’t be held liable for its
actions, so who is? Its manufacturer, programmer, commander, or
someone else?</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, Goose expounded upon concerns of proliferation, the
possibility that a further removal from killing would lead to more
war, and the fact that “killer bots” could be used as a tool of
repression for autocrats.</p>

<h2 id="rebuttal-arkin">Rebuttal: Arkin</h2>
<p>Arkin rebutted with the following points, among others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The AAAI Should play a leading role in defining what is meant by
“autonomy” and “meaningful human control”, not bureaucrats</li>
  <li>Neither tanks nor robots should be used in law enforcement</li>
  <li>Enforcement of a ban is infeasible</li>
  <li>If we can save human lives with this technology, it’s irresponsible to ignore it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that some points in this list rebutted not statements made
by Goose, but possible misconstruals of Arkin’s beliefs.</p>

<h2 id="rebuttal-goose">Rebuttal: Goose</h2>
<p>Goose rebutted that a moratorium is legally tricky, and that a
moratorium (as imposed by the DoD) would not inhibit research in any
way. He also dismissed the idea that “killer robots” could conceivably
be limited to constrained circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="final-remarks">Final Remarks</h2>
<p>After several questions from the audience (some more relevant than
others), closing remarks were made.</p>

<p>Arkin closed with three points.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If your research is of any value, it will eventually be misused</li>
  <li>He fully supports a moratorium</li>
  <li>We have a responsibility to try to save human lives.</li>
</ol>

<p>Goose’s closing statements reiterated that some weapons simply
shouldn’t be used.</p>

<h2 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h2>
<p>Ultimately, my thoughts on this issue come down to one question, also posed
by an audience member at the debate: while I agree that adding ethical safeguards to
robots could save human lives, how much of the ideal espoused by Arkin
requires the ability for robots to have the power of life and death?
The ability to “refuse to shoot” in unethical circumstances would be a
valuable addition to any weapon system, remotely controlled or
otherwise. This ability, however, would be unlikely to be affected by
a ban on autonomous weapon systems. Yes, robots will also be able to
autonomously perform targeting and firing better than humans, but does
this ability (the sole ability, as far as I can see, which <strong>would</strong>
be affected by the ban) help in the creation of ethical agents in any
way? I’m not sure it does.</p>
